<h1>RuneScriptKt</h1>
</div>

A fork of [Neptune](https://github.com/neptune-ps/neptune) (a project undertaking modern OSRS), this project is instead entirely RuneScript-focused.

There is a work-in-progress effort to port this to run in TypeScript, and this repo will be sunsetted in favor of a JRE-less setup eventually.

**You do not need to build this to use it. [Download from the Releases page](https://github.com/LostCityRS/RuneScriptKt/releases).**
